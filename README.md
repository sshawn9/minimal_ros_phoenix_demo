# minimal_ros_phoenix_demo
Embodying the resilience of the legendary phoenix, this module ensures that ROS nodes rise from the ashes of an unexpected roscore termination. Designed with robustness in mind, ros_phoenix automatically restores and resumes operation of ROS nodes when roscore is rebooted, minimizing downtime and ensuring consistent performance across robotic applications.
